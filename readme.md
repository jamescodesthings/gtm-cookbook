# The GTM Cookbook
An Open source cookbook for Google Tag Manager.

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

## Contents
If you want to jump straight in, take a look here.

[Naming Conventions](pages/naming-conventions.md)  
[Useful Variables](pages/default-variables.md)  

## Why?
Let's say, for whatever reason; you're going to hack a load of front-end changes into a website where CMS access and function is limited. You've chosen to use GTM because it's there, possible and probably the most straight forward way. Without using your A/B testing framework as an overlay generator.

This is hopefully the cookbook for you. It should give you what you need to structure Tag Manager tags, include the scripts you need, get the data you want and replace all the things.

## Background
Tag manager is Quirky, through the years there have been a few wonderful posts on how to do tricky stuff in GTM. Here's the ones I use.

### Variables
First, and probably the most useful, is the [Variables guide](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/variable-guide-google-tag-manager/) by Simo Ahava.

This guide will tell you absolutely everything you can do with GTM Variables.
