# Naming Conventions
Use these, they're good.

## Conventions to use
- **Variable**: `SNAKE_CASE_ALL_CAPS`  
- **Tag**: `PascalCase`  
- **Trigger**: `camelCase`  

## Why?
Tag Manager's Search function is pretty good. Searching for `jquery` when you have a tag, variable and trigger all defined with jquery in the name could be difficult. With a decent naming convetion you'll know which is which.

## Warning on Namespaces
It's common to see namespaces used in GTM, don't do that. `my_project_some_variable` suggests that a variable has limited scope, it usually doesn't so there's no point. It also makes searching for stuff a bit of a nightmare, the results list will be `my_proj...` which is no good.
